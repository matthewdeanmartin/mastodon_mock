/**
 * Token-safe console diagnostics for the account stable.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A user reported that leaving the app took their *other* saved accounts with
 * it. Reconstructing that from the outside was guesswork: the app is client-side
 * only, so nothing about it is visible in a server log, and every method that
 * writes `mastodon_mock_sessions` did so silently. The single line that caused
 * it (`logout()` calling `persistSessions(remaining)`) left no trace at all, and
 * the auto-switch that followed made the app look like it had merely *changed*
 * accounts rather than deleted one.
 *
 * So every transition that adds, removes, activates or deactivates a session
 * announces itself, and — this is the part that would actually have caught the
 * bug — reports the session count **before and after**. A count that drops on an
 * operation that is not supposed to forget anything is visible in the console at
 * the moment it happens, without needing to reproduce it.
 *
 * ## What is never logged
 *
 * Tokens, in whole or in part. Not even a prefix: these are bearer credentials
 * against a real instance, and a console log is pasted into bug reports. Sessions
 * are identified by their local `id` (an opaque UUID that authenticates nothing)
 * and by handle where one is known.
