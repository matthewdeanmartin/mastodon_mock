`mastodon_mock` is a stateful, local Mastodon REST API for tests and development. It runs a
real FastAPI server backed by in-memory or file-backed SQLite, so client code can post
statuses, follow accounts, build timelines, manage lists and filters, file reports, and
exercise OAuth/admin flows without touching a live instance.

Use it when you want the confidence of real HTTP and persisted state, without flaky
network tests, rate limits, public test posts, or hand-written response mocks.

Highlights:

- Real Mastodon-shaped HTTP API, tested against [Mastodon.py](https://github.com/halcy/Mastodon.py).
- Fast disposable SQLite state, with deterministic seed data and reset support.
- Pytest fixtures, a context manager, and decorator sugar for zero-boilerplate tests.
- Bulk sample-data generation for demos, UI work, and performance checks.
- Bundled web client and admin UI at `/_ui/` when the package includes the built frontend.
- Admin/moderation endpoints for account actions, reports, domain blocks, email blocks, and IP blocks.

## Installation

```bash
pipx install mastodon_mock
```

Or with pip:

```bash
pip install mastodon_mock
```

## Usage

Run the mock server:

```bash
mastodon_mock serve --in-memory
```

Point a client at it:

```python
from mastodon import Mastodon

client = Mastodon(access_token="mock_token", api_base_url="http://127.0.0.1:3000")
client.status_post("hello from a mock!")
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3000/_ui/` for the bundled browser UI when it is available. The UI
covers timelines, compose/reply, boost/favourite/bookmark, **quote posts**, threads,
profiles, search, lists, an **About this server** page (instance rules, terms of service,
custom emojis), an **announcements banner** (dismiss + emoji reactions), and an admin
panel (accounts, reports, domains, **announcements**, **trends**).

For a quick, good-looking demo with a small community already populated — multiple
accounts, follows, a quote post, announcements, rules, and terms of service — run:

```bash
mastodon_mock serve --in-memory --demo
```

For a populated local instance, generate a throwaway cohort into a SQLite file and point
your config's `[database].path` at it:

```bash
mastodon_mock gen-data --preset small --database ./mastodon_mock.sqlite --yes
```

### HTTPS (required for most Mastodon clients, e.g. Whalebird, Fedistar)

Desktop/mobile Mastodon clients connect to the entered domain over HTTPS regardless of
any scheme you type, so pointing one at a plain-HTTP `serve` instance fails with
`Invalid HTTP request received` in the server log (the client's TLS handshake hitting an
HTTP parser).

A plain openssl self-signed cert is often not enough — Electron-based clients
(Whalebird, Fedistar) commonly refuse to connect at all rather than warn-and-allow like a
browser does. Use [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) instead: it installs a
local CA into your OS trust store and issues certs signed by it, so clients trust the
connection outright.

```bash
make dev-cert      # generates .dev_certs/ via mkcert if installed, else falls back to openssl
make serve-https    # dev-cert + serve --in-memory --demo --port 3443 over HTTPS
```

Or run the steps by hand:

```bash
mkcert -install   # one-time: adds a local CA to the OS/browser trust stores
mkcert -key-file .dev_certs/localhost-key.pem -cert-file .dev_certs/localhost-cert.pem \
  localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1

mastodon_mock serve --in-memory --demo --port 3443 \
  --ssl-keyfile .dev_certs/localhost-key.pem --ssl-certfile .dev_certs/localhost-cert.pem
```

Point the client at `https://127.0.0.1:3443` (or `localhost`). Without mkcert installed,
`gen-dev-cert.sh` falls back to an openssl self-signed cert, but expect Electron clients
to refuse it outright rather than just warn.

See [HTTPS and Real Mastodon Clients](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/mastodon_mock/blob/main/docs/usage/https-and-real-clients.md) for the full
walkthrough (mkcert setup, troubleshooting, and how `serve` derives a reachable
domain for avatar/header/status URLs).

## Why I think this works

- 100s of unit tests
  - Integration tests via live server
  - Integration tests via Angular client
- Unit tests using mastodon-py
- Hand tested with half a dozen clients
- Bundled with an Angular client written specifically to test the mock server
- Schema compared with the reverse engineered OpenAPI schema
- Tested against five of my own Mastodon projects
- Test data generation uses mastodon-mock

## Tested on...

- Tuba - Works, but had to use port 443 and edit hosts file so cert matched domain (mock.local in my case)
- Whalebird- Works!
- Fedistar - couldn't get it to trust local certificate
- Dowstodon - Works!
- Various web - They need to make a serverside request to my machine. Can't do it, without putting a mock server on public web.
- toot - can't test on Windows
- Sengi - couldn't get this to work? But not sure the Sengi app is finished either (as of 6/2026)?
